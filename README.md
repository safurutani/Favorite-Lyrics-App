# Favorite Lyrics App
This application is a product of the android developer jetpack compose course. The pathway focused on scrolling lists and prompted me to create a "30 day app". 

I decided to implement what I learned into an app that displays lyrics that make me think of my favorite person. The list is actually 31 songs with the artist, title, and album art on a card. These cards are expandable so when the arrow is clicked the lyrics are revealed, but they can also be hidden again as they are intended to take up the majority of screen space. I tried to customize it to a color scheme that they would like (purple) and used font that I liked. A light and dark mode are also supported as well as horizontal viewing.
